# Modules and the Dashboard

---

To configure the bot, navigate to the dashboard, which is located [here](https://sned.hypersden.com/dashboard). After logging in with your Discord account, you will see a list of servers where both you, and the bot are members of, and where you have either `Administrator` or `Manage Server` permissions. If your serverlist is empty, add the bot to a new server, or ask your server owner for appropriate permissions to manage the bot.

After clicking on a server, you will be able to see some statistics relating to the server, enable or disable modules, toggle permissions, or change module settings. For a detailed rundown on the options for each module, please see the subchapters.
